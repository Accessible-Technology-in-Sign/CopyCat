CopyCat
=======

CopyCat is an American Sign Language (ASL) game for deaf children. The goal is to help young deaf children develop language skills. CopyCat allows these children to practice their ASL through a fun game.

This game was made by the Contextual Computing Group at Georgia Tech.

## Plot

Iris has to save her friends from a Bad Santa who has stolen them. On her way, she'll encounter enemies and will have to use her magical ASL abilities to get past them.

## How it Works

Copycat used to work with Kinect cameras and toolkit to capture user signs and then run through a classifier that was able to recognize ASL phrases. This has been converted to a more modern Mediapipe and TFLite pipeline - similar to what is used in PopSign.AI
